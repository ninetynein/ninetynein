				<h2>Planned Work</h2>
				<p>Although we've come a long way, the work on the boat seems never ending.  In no particular order, I present to you - stuff I gotta get done!  
				Let's start with some physical stuff:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>grease and inspect motor mount - It's really difficult to raise and lower the outboard</li>
					<li>plexi glass hatch door - I have a really nice piece of frosted 1cm acrylic that will replace the rotted plywood we have now</li>
					<li>Set up running lights - This is really critical.  You never know when you're going to get caught out after dark</li>
					<li>Finish the interior (sand, epoxy, and build covers for wood runners) - Nothing like spending a beautiful summers day in the bowels of your 
					boat with a respirator on covered in toxic dust!</li>
					<li>Install toilet - Ummm, yea</li>
					<li>Fix up the counter - The old stove has been removed, leaving a gaping hole in the counter.  I have a new stove to put in.</li>
					<li>Install cooler - There's a tricky bit of space under the counter that I'd like to install a cooler in</li>
					<li>Install solar panel - Gotta keep that battery happy</li>
					<li>Install airflow hatch - The original hatch was removed.  Maybe someday I'll do this.  Hey, at least it's on the list!</li>
					<li>Replace water tank filler hose - The current hose is way to thin.  It's developed a kink that causes problems when trying to fill the tank</li>
					<li>Replace sink drain hose with PEX - Truth be told, the copper's probably fine.  I just have an unhealthy love for PEX</li>
					<li>Sliding doors over cabinet - These are the doors that will cover the cooler so it doesn't fly out and kill one of us</li>
					<li>Drawer slide for cooler - Again with the cooler.  In the current counter design, there's no way to actually open the cooler.
					My plan is to put the whole thing on a large bottom mount drawer slide and just slide it out to access it.</li>
					<li>Build half wall on port side by v-berth - I see a lot of other boats have this.  Besides, it would give you a little privacy in the privy</li>
					<li>Build a spot in the gas locker to store propane bottles - Apparently, it's bad feng shui to store your propane bottles inside.  The only outside 
					space we have is in the gas locker so I thought I'd build something to help dampen the inevitable explosion</li>
					<li>Buy and install compass - High priority</li>
					<li>Buy and install depth sounder - Running into the ground is a very expensive way to clean your keel</li>
					<li>Make sure bitter end is tied off properly - How much would it suck to watch our brand new anchor and rope sink to the bottom?  A lot, that's how much.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Then there's the work for when we finally get it to dry dock</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Scrub, sand, and paint the bottom - I'm thinking Pirate Black!</li>
					<li>Install a depth sounder - It's way cheaper when it's out of the water</li>
					<li>Get it inspected - We've decided to hire a boat inspector to take a look at her while she's out of the water.</li>
				</ul>
